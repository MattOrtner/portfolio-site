          As a web developer and passionate dancer, I bring a unique perspective
          to my work. <br /> <br /> My background in dance has instilled in me a
          love for creativity, attention to detail, collaboration, and
          discipline, which I carry over into my career as a web developer.
          <br /> <br /> I am a creative problem-solver who is always eager to
          learn new techniques and technologies. If you are looking for a web
          developer who brings a unique perspective and a passion for creating
          high-quality web solutions, please contact me through LinkedIn. <br />
          <br />
          Hope your having a great day!
          <br />- Matt
